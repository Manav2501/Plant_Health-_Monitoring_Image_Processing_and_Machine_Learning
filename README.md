# Plant_Health-_Monitoring_Image_Processing_and_Machine_Learning

Built a prototype of a plant health monitoring system created without human intervention. An alert will be generated and the user will be notified in case of any discrepancies found in the plant health. The live streaming of the data of the sensors and video feed will be sent to the user through the internet and the user can monitor it on his laptop/mobile device. And the data process and insight will obtain plant growth. The images taken by the camera is processed using Image Processing Algorithms and Machine Learning algorithms is used to make predictions about the health of the plant.
